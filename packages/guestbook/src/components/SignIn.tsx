                This app demonstrates a key element of NEAR’s UX: once an app has
                permission to make calls on behalf of a user (that is, once a user signs
                in), the app can make calls to the blockchain for them without prompting
                extra confirmation. So you’ll see that if you don’t include a donation,
                your message gets posted right to the guest book.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if you do add a donation, then NEAR will double-check that you’re ok
                with sending money to this app.
            </p>
            <p>Go ahead and sign in to try it out!</p>
